# DECISIONS — V5 "Field notebook × terminal" port

Record of what I chose and why while porting the V5 design (handoff
bundle in `design_handoff_v5_field_notebook/` outside the repo) into the
existing Astro + React-islands codebase. Read this before reviewing the
diff — it explains intent, not just code.

Branch: `v5-field-notebook` (off `origin/main` at commit `e117f3d`).

---

## 1. Reversibility — the most important decision

**Single-line revert.** `src/components/pages/AppShell.tsx` has a `USE_V5`
constant at the top. Flip to `false` → the entire site falls back to V4.
No other file change needed.

Why this matters:
- All V4 files (`HomeV4.tsx`, `WritingIndexV4.tsx`, …, `legacy.tsx`,
  V4 chrome, V4 palette tokens) are **untouched**.
- All V5 work is **additive** — new files in `src/components/chrome/NB.tsx`,
  `src/components/pages/*V5.tsx`, plus appended-only edits to three files
  (`palette.ts`, `posts.ts`, `global.css`).
- If V5 breaks production, the rollback is one prop flip and a re-deploy.
- Once V5 is signed off and we want to drop V4 entirely, that's a separate
  PR that deletes the V4 files. Doing it in one commit would make rollback
  much harder.

---

## 2. What's preserved vs. what changed

> User instruction: *"don't erase my data, these are only style guides."*

**Preserved verbatim:**
- All essay bodies (`src/components/essays/*Essay.tsx`) — zero changes.
  V5 wraps them in new chrome via a palette adapter (§4).
- All MDX content (`src/content/essays/*.mdx`) — untouched.
- All `/data/now.ts` content (FOCUSES, JOURNAL, CONDITIONS) — NowV5 reads
  the same arrays.
- All `/data/posts.ts` essay entries — new fields added (§3), but no
  existing field removed or changed.
- All V4 chrome and page components — left in place for rollback.
- The Astro layout (`BaseLayout.astro`), routing (`src/pages/*.astro`),
  diagrams (`src/components/diagrams/*`), and `setCursorColor`/cursor
  tracker — unchanged.

**Net-new content I authored** (called out so you can swap with your own copy):
- Home + Work toolbox skills, seven categories (Languages / Tools /
  Libraries / ML-Data / Physics / Other / Soft skills). Populated from
  `final_CV.pdf` (Feb 2024) plus Orion-era stack (Rust/Golang/geospatial
  ML) carried forward from existing site prose. Home is curated; Work is
  comprehensive. The interests row ("Off-keyboard") was dropped — rowing
  / piano / STEM-ed / fashion already live in the hero bio paragraph.
  Colour system documented in §15 below.
- Home builds card (`HomeV5.tsx`, `HOME_BUILDS` array) — three current
  deployed projects with one-liner blurbs.
- Writing index "working notes" rows (`WritingIndexV5.tsx`,
  `WORKING_NOTES`). Three example rows from the V5 prototype's data.
- Writing index drafts list (`WritingIndexV5.tsx`, `DRAFTS`). Two example
  draft filenames; swap with real ones.
- Marginalia copy ("first solve it on paper. then in code." on Home;
  "every essay has a hand-coded diagram. no D3." on Writing; etc.). All
  from the V5 prototype.
- Last-updated stamp date (`26 may 2026` everywhere). Hardcoded — should
  be wired to a real "last touched" timestamp eventually.
- Telemetry JSON pre-block in NowV5 (London lat/lon). Static values.
- PGP fingerprint section in `ContactV5.tsx` — **omitted**. The V5
  prototype showed a placeholder fingerprint; rather than invent one,
  I dropped the block entirely. Re-add when you have a real key.

---

## 3. Data model — `posts.ts` extension

Per the V5 spec, each essay carries a **topic family** + a per-essay accent
key. The V4 single-cobalt `accent` field needed to be replaced — but V4 is
still running, so I added new optional fields instead of swapping:

```ts
type Post = {
  // ... existing V4 fields untouched ...
  family?: "ai" | "quantum" | "bio" | "optim" | "markets" | "ml" | "ecology" | "physics";
  nbAccent?: NBAccentKey;  // → resolves against NB_LIGHT / NB_DARK in palette.ts
};
```

Slug → accent mapping (from the V5 spec's topic-family table):

| Slug                      | Family    | nbAccent   |
|---------------------------|-----------|------------|
| `bluedot-unit1`           | ai        | `blue`     |
| `zx-calculus`             | quantum   | `prompt`   |
| `jaya`                    | optim     | `orange`   |
| `fashion-trends`          | markets   | `ochre`    |
| `threshold-gate`          | bio       | `magenta`  |
| `constraint-clustering`   | bio       | `red`      |
| `six-engines`             | ml        | `purple`   |
| `may-2026`                | ecology   | `teal`     |

`threshold-gate` and `constraint-clustering` are both `bio` — magenta and
red per the V5 spec's "two essays in a family → use sibling shade" rule.

If you add a new essay later: pick a `family`, assign the family's primary
colour as `nbAccent`. Only fall back to a sibling shade when the family
already has two adjacent essays in the same primary colour.

---

## 4. Palette adapter for unchanged essay bodies

Essay TSX components (`JayaEssay.tsx`, etc.) expect the V4 palette shape:
`{ accent, ink, paper, line, muted }`. Rather than rewrite them, `ArticleV5`
synthesises that shape from the NB theme + the essay's `nbAccent`:

```ts
const essayPalette = {
  paper: t.paper,
  ink: t.ink,
  muted: t.muted,
  line: t.rule,       // V4's "line" → NB's "rule"
  accent,             // = t[post.nbAccent]
};
<Body palette={essayPalette} />
```

This means **every essay's chrome (figures, pull quotes, sidenote numbers,
inline code blocks) automatically picks up the per-essay accent** without
touching essay source. Zero churn on essay files.

---

## 5. Pinned essays on the home page

V5 design pins three essays at the top of Home. I went with `POSTS.slice(0, 3)`
— first three in the POSTS array, currently `bluedot-unit1`, `zx-calculus`,
`jaya`. Matches the V5 prototype's `nbEssays` ordering.

If you want a different pinning rule (e.g. "newest 3", "editor's pick"),
the `pinned` variable in `HomeV5.tsx` is two lines — easy to swap to
`POSTS.slice(-3).reverse()` or to a hardcoded slug list.

---

## 6. Polaroid thumbnails

V5 spec calls for real PNGs at `public/thumbs/<slug>.png`. None exist yet
(per spec — "user will supply"). `NBThumb` falls back to a striped
accent-coloured placeholder with a 3-letter mono label.

When you drop in real PNGs:
- pass `src={`/thumbs/${slug}.png`}` from `HomeV5` and `WritingIndexV5`
- the striped placeholder vanishes automatically

I didn't add the `src` prop to the existing thumb usages because the PNGs
aren't there yet — would produce 404s in browser dev tools.

---

## 7. Mode toggle wiring

V5 chrome has no explicit theme switcher — the `light · 100×42` /
`dark · 100×42` label in the mac chrome doubles as a click target. I wired
that label to `toggleTheme` so the existing pre-paint script + localStorage
plumbing in `BaseLayout.astro` keep working. No regression to the existing
dark-mode flow.

---

## 8. Mobile responsiveness

V5 is a desktop-first design (1440×2300 canvas in the handoff). I added a
single mobile breakpoint via the existing `useIsMobile()` hook (768px). On
mobile each page:
- collapses the right rail under the main column
- shrinks the H1 via `clamp()`
- replaces fixed-width 12-col grids with single-column stacks
- horizontally scrolls the tab strip if it overflows
- hides the marginalia (positioned absolute on desktop; doesn't fit narrow)
- drops the polaroid thumbnails next to essay rows (would be too wide)
- shrinks per-build "where" / "year" metadata into stacked lines

The mobile pass is "good enough"; not a from-scratch mobile design. If you
want a tighter mobile pass, list it as a follow-up.

---

## 9. Tab strip — current page detection

V5 tabs are `~/home`, `~/writing`, `~/work`, `~/now`, `~/contact`. The
essay page uses `current="essay"` but the tab strip highlights `~/writing`
in that case (since essays live under `/writing/<slug>/` logically even
though Astro routes them as `/<slug>/`).

---

## 10. NB primitives bundled in one file

`src/components/chrome/NB.tsx` contains all 12 V5 primitives — `NBPageShell`,
`NBMacChrome`, `NBTabStrip`, `NBLastUpdated`, `NBPrompt`, `NBPromptHead`,
`NBBlinker`, `NBThumbtack`, `NBThumb`, `NBMarginalia`, `NBStatusFooter`,
`NBMiniTerm`, `NBDiagramPlaceholder`.

The existing convention is one-component-per-file. I deviated because:
- The handoff structures it the same way (`nb-shared.jsx` is a single bundle)
- The primitives reference each other (NBPageShell calls NBMacChrome,
  NBTabStrip, NBStatusFooter) — keeping them adjacent reduces import noise
- Reversibility benefit: one file to delete on rollback

If review prefers per-file, splitting is a mechanical refactor.

---

## 11. AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md

The V5 handoff included a draft AGENTS-v5.md that supersedes V4's rules in
several places (per-essay accent vs site-wide cobalt; shell prompts above
section headings; marginalia; etc.). I did **not** update the in-repo
`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` yet — both still reference `index.html` (the
pre-Astro state). Suggested follow-up: apply the V5 patch to AGENTS.md
once V5 is signed off, and add Astro-aware guidance.

---

## 12. What I did NOT do

- Did not delete any V4 component, palette, or data field.
- Did not add real polaroid PNGs (none provided).
- Did not invent biographical content, project names, dates, or citations.
- Did not push the branch to remote, did not merge to main. Per user
  instruction: "keep it in a branch and local, not push to main / merge to
  main until i ask."
- Did not modify `BaseLayout.astro`, the OG image route, RSS feed,
  capture-figures script, or any of the existing diagrams.
- Did not add a PGP fingerprint to ContactV5 (no real key available).

---

## 13. How to revert

```bash
# Full revert (one line)
# In src/components/pages/AppShell.tsx, change:
const USE_V5 = true;   →   const USE_V5 = false;
```

Commit + push → site reverts to V4. V5 files stay in the tree but unused.
If you want them gone too: `git rm src/components/chrome/NB.tsx
src/components/diagrams/NotebookLotka.tsx src/components/pages/*V5.tsx
DECISIONS-v5.md` and revert the additive edits to `palette.ts`, `posts.ts`,
`global.css`.

---

## 14. Colour system — 10 canonical topic categories

Earlier passes layered two colour axes (essays = topic-coded, toolbox =
skill-type-coded), which produced unrelated overlaps (e.g. `blue` meant
"AI" for the bluedot essay AND "Languages" for the toolbox category).
The legibility complaint was real.

**Current system (canonical):** the site has **10 meta-topic categories**,
each owning one of the 10 NB pens. Every essay, project, skill, and
toolbox chip rolls up to exactly one of them, and inherits that
category's pen colour. The 10 categories were chosen to cover everything
on the site without gaps. More-specific sub-topics (e.g. "ecology",
"immunology", "graph theory", "category theory") roll up to a parent
meta-topic and share its colour — the colour is the internal taxonomy.

### The 10 canonical categories

| #  | Category                                  | Pen              | What rolls up here                                                                          |
|----|-------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | AI safety                                  | `blue`           | bluedot · alignment · AI ethics · governance · policy                                        |
| 2  | AI/ML    | `purple`         | classical ML · NLP · LLM eng (Claude / Gemini / prompt eng / evals) · optim · feature eng    |
| 3  | Mathematics                                | `magenta`        | game / cat / graph theory · complexity · GDL · cryptography · linear algebra                 |
| 4  | Physics                                    | `prompt` (green) | quantum · ZX-calculus · atmospheric · GNSS · satellite remote sensing                     |
| 5  | Biotech                                    | `red`            | biology · ecology · bioinformatics · biomarkers · immunology · comp-bio                      |
| 6  | Geospatial                                 | `teal`           | geospatial ML · GIS · H3 indexing · mapping · spatial analysis                                |
| 7  | fintech                                    | `ochre`          | LMSR · time-series · forecasting · recommendations · prediction markets · trading            |
| 8  | Hardware                                   | `cyan`           | IoT · embedded · HDL · compiler / VM · electronics · sensors                                 |
| 9  | Infrastructure                             | `yellow`         | data arch · UI / UX · web stack · cloud · DevOps · languages-as-infra · design tools         |
| 10 | Outreach                                   | `orange`         | mentoring · leadership · STEM-ed · DBS · stakeholder comm · founding · marketing             |

### Slotting rule

A skill that genuinely serves multiple topics picks its **primary** one
(the topic it most-often earned its place in this user's work).
Provenance to other topics is preserved via essay link-colours inside
the chip — but the chip's own colour is one and only one category.

Examples:
- **Python** → ML technical research (purple). Used in JAYA, threshold-
  gate, six-engines — but the *skill* is general-purpose ML scripting.
- **R** → ML technical research (purple). Taylor rec original was R/Shiny
  ML; FLAME peer tutoring was Python + R for analytics.
- **Rust / Golang** → Geospatial (teal). Orion-only.
- **C++** → Hardware (cyan). IoT weather bot.
- **Constrained clustering** → Biotech (red). Even though it's an
  ML technique, on this site it earned its place in the comp-bio essay.

### Link colour rules (inside each chip)

The chip has **two layers of colour**, deliberately:

- **Left border + group label = category** (the meta-topic).
- **Each `↗ link` text = provenance** (where the skill earned its place):

| Link `href`                       | Text colour                              |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `/<slug>/` (essay route)          | that essay's accent (`POSTS[i].nbAccent`) |
| `https://…` (project URL, GitHub) | chip's category primary                   |
| `/uploads/…CV…pdf`                | chip's category primary                   |
| `/work/`, `/writing/`, `/`, `/now/` | chip's category primary                  |

### Essay accent flips (v5)

Switching to this canonical system required flipping four essay accents
so each essay sits in exactly one of the 10 categories:

| Essay                  | Before     | After      | Reason                          |
|------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| `jaya`                 | `orange`   | `purple`   | ML technical research absorbs optim |
| `threshold-gate`       | `magenta`  | `red`      | Biotech (was bio "low-signal")    |
| `six-engines`          | `purple`   | `ochre`    | Recommendations roll up to markets |
| `may-2026`             | `teal`     | `red`      | Ecology rolls up to biotech       |

Unchanged: `bluedot-unit1` (blue), `zx-calculus` (prompt-green),
`fashion-trends` (ochre), `constraint-clustering` (red).

### Where to make new content fit

When adding an essay, a project, a skill, or a CV entry: pick the **one
meta-topic** it most belongs to from the table above, set
`POSTS[i].family` + `POSTS[i].nbAccent` accordingly, or for chips set
the parent group's `primary`. The chip colour follows automatically.

### Data-file pattern (page editing)

Each V5 page is a **pure renderer** that imports its content from a
single data file. Components live in `src/components/pages/*V5.tsx`;
copy lives in `src/data/<page>.ts`. The status footer's "edit this page
→" link opens the relevant data file in GitHub's web editor.

| Page surface | Data file | Edits include |
|---|---|---|
| `/` (HomeV5)        | `src/data/home.ts`    | hero spans, bio, marginalia, builds, toolbox, contact slip, fig captions, all labels |
| `/writing/`         | `src/data/writing.ts` | hero, lede, marginalia, working notes, drafts list |
| `/work/`            | `src/data/work.ts`    | hero, marginalia, trajectory events, builds, toolbox (~70 chips), speaking, right-rail blocks |
| `/now/`             | `src/data/now.ts`     | hero, lede, marginalia, focuses, journal entries, conditions, telemetry JSON |
| `/contact/`         | `src/data/contact.ts` | hero, marginalia, channels, preferences, compose form copy, protocol JSON, calendar |
| `/<essay-slug>/`    | `src/components/essays/<Name>.tsx` + `src/data/posts.ts` | essay TSX body + the post metadata |

**Adding new content** means editing the data file, not the TSX. A new
entry inherits its colour automatically from its `family` or its group's
`primary`. If you add a new section to a page that needs JSX layout
changes, that goes in the TSX — but the strings inside it should still
flow from the data file.

**Inline-coloured prose**: `home.ts` defines a `Span` type used by all
pages for multi-coloured runs of text:
- `string` → plain text
- `{ em, c }` → italic display-serif fragment, coloured by `c`
- `{ tag, c }` → non-italic coloured fragment (used for keyword tags)

Each page imports `Span` from `home.ts` to avoid duplicating the type.

### Strict-alignment exceptions (universal-status conventions)

The full site is routed through the canonical 10 above. A small set of
chrome elements stay outside the topical system because they carry
*universal status meaning* that's stronger than any topic:

- **`prompt`-green status dots** (`● connected`, `● ready`, `● connected · zsh 5.9`)
  read as "okay / live" by universal convention. The V5 spec itself
  defines green as "okay states" — keeping these green preserves the
  signal. Changing per-topic would break the cue.
- **Terminal cursor blink** (`NBBlinker`) — prompt-green by universal
  terminal-cursor convention.
- **Trajectory current-job dot** on WorkV5 §02 — prompt-green = "active"
  status marker.
- **Mac chrome traffic lights** (red/yellow/green) — system colours,
  not from the NB palette.
- **JSON syntax highlighting** inside pre-blocks (`{ "key": "value" }`
  in ContactV5 protocol, NowV5 telemetry, ArticleV5 essay meta) —
  keys + values use a blue/ochre/orange pattern for readability of
  JSON syntax. The enclosing block's `NBPrompt` accent carries the
  topical signal; the syntax inside is decorative.

Everything else — chip border, link text, marginalia, last-updated
stamp, section headers, hero accent italics, builds card, OG cards,
focus rows, condition cards, channel rows, preference rows — is
strictly canonical.

### Per-page page-level topic resolution

For chrome that needs *a* topical accent but the page isn't a single
topic, use this default:

| Page                              | Default accent                    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `/` (HomeV5)                      | yellow for meta-stamp; per-content topical accents inline |
| `/writing/` (WritingIndexV5)      | yellow (Infrastructure & craft — essay-craft)             |
| `/work/` (WorkV5)                 | yellow (Infrastructure & craft — career/building)          |
| `/now/` (NowV5)                   | orange (Outreach — personal current state)                 |
| `/contact/` (ContactV5)           | orange (Outreach — communication)                          |
| `/<slug>/` (ArticleV5)            | that essay's `nbAccent`                                    |

**Every chip-link has a real href.** Resolution order:
- `/<slug>/` where `<slug>` is a known essay → in-site essay route,
  link text gets that essay's accent
- `/work/`, `/writing/`, `/` → in-site nav
- `https://…` → external (opens in new tab); GitHub repo, project URL
- `/uploads/Shubhangi-Sharma-Resume-…pdf` → CV PDF (opens in new tab)

CV is the fallback when a skill has no on-site destination (Oxford
modules, pre-CV jobs, college projects). The constant `CV_PDF` is at
the top of both `HomeV5.tsx` and `WorkV5.tsx` for easy update.

## 15. How to verify locally

```bash
cd /Users/shubzpersonal2/.superset/worktrees/personal-site/v5-field-notebook
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:4321/
```

Open `/`, `/writing/`, `/work/`, `/now/`, `/contact/`, and any essay slug
(e.g. `/jaya/`). Click the `light · 100×42` chip in the mac chrome to
toggle dark mode. Click any tab to navigate.

If something looks wrong: flip `USE_V5 = false` in `AppShell.tsx` to
confirm V4 still works (sanity check that nothing was inadvertently
broken).
